# Spear Component

Spear support component. This is similar to other web framework like Vue, Astro.

## Simple usage

This is most simple component example:

- `/src/components/test-component.spear`
```html\n
<div>\n
  <h1>This is test component</h1>\n
</div>\n
```

- `/src/index.html`
```
<body>\n
  <test-component></test-component>\n
</body>\n
```

The generated HTML is :

- `/dist/index.html`
```
<!DOCTYPE html>\n
<html lang="en">\n
<head>\n
  <meta charset="UTF-8">\n
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">\n
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">\n
  <title>{{projectName}}</title>\n
</head>\n
<body>\n
  <div>\n
    <h1>This is test component</h1>\n
  </div>\n
</body>\n
</html>\n
```
