# Build

It is easy to build the spear project. You just execute `yarn build` command.

```bash
# yarn install\n
# yarn build\n
....\n
[Parse Pages]\n
  [Page]: index(/)\n
\n
[Page]: articles/index\n
\n
[Page]: /index\n
[Sitemap]: /sitemap.xml\n
```

The generated directory is `dist` by default. You can check this directory.


## Dev mode

Spear has dev mode which has hot-realod feature. If you type `yarn dev` command, Spear will be started as dev mode.

```bash
# yarn dev\n
...\n
[Parse Pages]\n
  [Page]: index(/)\n
\n
[Page]: articles/index\n
\n
[Page]: /index\n
\n
    Server started on port 8080 ðŸš€\n
    You can access the following URL:\n
\n
      http://localhost:8080\n
```

You can check generated site by accessing [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

Note that:
- If your machine use 8080 port, this dev mode failed. If you faced `8080 is already in use.` error, you should check local environment.
  - In this case, you can change port via settings file. For detail, see [install document](/intro/install.html).
